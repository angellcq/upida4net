Thank you for using Upida.

There is one example project:
MyClients - This is advanced MVVM web application, extremely easy to implement and support.
This is also great example on how to create MVC applications with angular.js and Upida.
This example shows you how to use Upida to create robust validation.

You can start using Upida in your own projects.
The file "upida.angular.js" can greatly simplify your efforts.
Copy this file to your project resources folder and start using it.
Don't forget to setup $upida.settings.baseUrl property to the home directory of your application (see app.js file in examples).

Good luck !
