You can start using Upida in your own projects.
The file "upida.utils.angular.js" or "upida.utils.knockout.js" can greatly simplify your effors.
You don't have to use these files, but you can use them as a good starting point.
Open the "upida.utils.angular.js" or "upida.utils.knockout.js" file and set up your project folder name (line 5).
Copy this file to your project resources folder and start using it.

Good luck !
