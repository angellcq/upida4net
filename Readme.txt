You can start using Upida in your own projects.
The file "upida.angular.js" or "upida.knockout.js" can greatly simplify your effors.
Copy this file to your project resources folder and start using it.
Don't forget to setup upida.baseUrl property to the home directory of your application (see app.js file in examples).

Good luck !
